        <h2>Desription</h2>

        <p>GỎI CUỐN is Vietnamese dish traditionally made up of pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli noodles, and herbs rolled in Vietnamese rice paper. 
            They were given their name because they were originally filled with seasonal spring vegetables. 
            Typically, you can find gỏi cuốn at any Vietnamese restaurant as an appetizer, but normally they only give you about 2-3 cut rolls.</p>
        
        <p>Vietnamese spring rolls are one of the most popular and recognized Vietnamese dishes. 
           They may appear simple, however, these rolls showcase a culinary technique with lovely texture and contrasting 
           flavors that when combined create so much more than the sum of their simple parts.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li><strong><p>Pork Roast Loin:</strong> Try to find a pork loin that isn't overly fatty and boneless.</p></li>  
            <li><strong><p>Shrimp:</strong> I love using the biggest, juiciest shrimps I can find. Cook the shrimp before peeling and deveining.</p></li>
            <li><strong><p>Salt and Sugar:</strong> are used to softly season the boiling water.</p></li>
            <li><strong><p>Rice paper:</strong> Vietnamese rice paper (bánh tráng) is a thin flat rice circular sheet that is made with rice, tapioca flour, salt, and water.</p></li>
            <li><strong><p>Vermicelli Rice noodles:</strong> Thin vermicelli rice noodles are a common staple in Vietnamese cuisine. You can find the Vermicelli Rice Noodles online or in your local Asian grocery store.</p></li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
            <li><p>In a large bowl or rice paper bowl pour in warm water around 120 F. Next, dip the rice paper into the water submerging the entire paper, 
                and then lay it on a plate that is slightly larger than the rice paper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add your vegetables. Place the lettuce first then the cucumber, and herbs on the edge of the rice paper closest to you leaving about 1-2 inches for you to grab onto.</p></li>  
            <li><p>Layer in the noodles. Then, add in your preferred amount of vermicelli rice noodles. The more noodles you add the bigger and fatter the roll will be. Careful not to add too many noodles you will risk bursting the rice paper.</p></li>  
            <li><p>Add in the pork and shrimp. About 3 pork slices and 3 shrimps. To have the shrimp appear on the outside of the roll, place the shrimp in a horizontal line directly on top of the rice paper above the veggies.</p></li>    
            <li><p>Begin rolling the rice paper. Lift the rice paper on the edge closest to you and make your first fold.</p></li>
            <li><p>Fold in the left and right edges of the rice paper to seal the ends and prevent the contents from spilling out.</p></li>
            <li><p>Continue tightly rolling the roll upward until no more rice paper remains. Use your hands to tightly roll the spring roll and prevent too much air from entering.</p></li>
